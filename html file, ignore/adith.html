</p>This is a hand coded project. Started when I was 10, it has taken nearly 3 years to complete this. I hope you enjoy.

PS: the main project is in python, the html part of the code is the code for the bit.ly link at the end of the code.

Run in on repl.it here - https://replit.com/github/Adithr123/pizza


Keep in mind that this is still in progress, and I will keep updating.
